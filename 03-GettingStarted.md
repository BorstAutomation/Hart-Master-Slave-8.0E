# Getting Started

1. Open the solution .\03-Slave\CppHartSlave-8.0E.sln with Visual Studio 2022.

   It has to be 2022. Older versions are not supported.
   Unless you have 2022 not installed on your computer. You can download it from Microsoft:
   https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/
   The community version is sufficient enough and free of charge. :-)

2. Perform a 'Build All'.

3. Start debugging ..
   .. and investigate the source code.

4. If a problem arises we would be happy to help you find the cause and eliminate it.
