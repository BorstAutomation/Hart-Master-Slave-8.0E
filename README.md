Since a stack for digital communication is no longer something special today, I decided to make the source code for a Hart Slave and a Hart Master available in a Github repository.

The special thing about my implementation is the way it is done and an application developer can only see that in details of the source code and the configuration of the development environment.

The Hart protocol itself and the interfaces to the application are written in C++. I placed great importance on storing all functions and declarations that are independent of a slave or master in common directories.

In the version setting 8.0E the 'E' stands for Experimental.
